## This [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leo/leo.github.io.svg?branch=master)][1]

... is where I settle down to write down my thoughts. Sometimes it's a helpful tip, sometimes an idea and sometimes just bullshit. There's only one thing I can [guarantee][2]: Before you become bored, the hell will freeze over.

So I guess there's only one thing left to clarify. And that's why the fuck I'm hosting my site here, in a repository on a collaborating platform for code: Because it's so convenient. I don't need to worry about deployment and at the sime time, people can access all of my stuff without detours.

## Caught a bug?

If you want to fix an issue or just try building the site locally for fun, start like this:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Jekyll and another gem: `gem install jekyll && gem install github-pages`
3. `cd` into the respository folder
4. Run Jekyll: `jekyll serve --watch`

Executing those commands might take a while. But if you get something like "You don't have write permissions", you know that an error occured. In this case, just try executing the commands again. But this time, with `sudo` at the beginning (executes the commands as root user).

## "Are you a magician?"

Who knows. But that's definitely not the reason why all the assets on the site are minfied, although Jekyll isn't able to provide me with such a service. It's [CloudFlare][3] who does that.

If you want to read more about how this exactly works, just read [this][4].
