Greetings! My name is @llazzaro, otherwise known as Leonardo Lazzaro, a computer scientist hailing from Argentina.

Presently, I reside in the city of Eindhoven in The Netherlands. I have a strong passion for open source development, as it affords me the opportunity to expand my knowledge and give back to the community at the same time.

I have a particular interest in serverless architecture and achieving high scalability in my projects. My expertise lies primarily in the Python programming language, but I also enjoy working with Go Lang. Currently, I am in the process of learning Rust, as I believe it will add an extra level of versatility to my skill set.

If you'd like to connect with me or learn more about my work, you can find me on:
