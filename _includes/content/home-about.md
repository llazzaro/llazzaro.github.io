# Leonardo Lazzaro

Computer Scientist, PhD dropout and never ending studying. I'm always fooled by randomness.

Currently I design and build software for a living. I have working knowledge of Python, Javascript and Go. I enjoy improving the performance on software.

In my free time I like to explore the ether, experiment with SEO (Search engine optimization)  and take some photos with my fujifilm camera.
